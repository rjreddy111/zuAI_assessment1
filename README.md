In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
To run the frontEnd 


Steps how I have build this 
1. Created backend using Express by installing all npm packages whichever required like sqlite, sqlite3, cors etc
2. created Database file in the root directory
3. Added end points and checked working fuctionality of end points in localhost:5001 using
   ### `app.js`
   from ./zuaiBackend directory
5. Deployed the backend on the Render

On frontEnd steps involved 
1. created react app using command ### create-react-app app-name
2. Entered into the particular path using cd /app-name
3. using fetech menthod used the backend deployed url to access the data from the backed
4. Provided different routes to handle and interact with the backend
